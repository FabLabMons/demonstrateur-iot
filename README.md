# Click IoT Board
## Purpose
This board aims to provide a starting point for building LTE Cat 1 projects for collecting data from a range of sensors.
These sensors can be connected on the I2C and SPI interfaces via a 4-wires connector.
Sensor boards will be hosted on a separate repository.

## Miscellaneous
We use the open source CAD tool KiCAD to build our boards: https://www.kicad.org/
